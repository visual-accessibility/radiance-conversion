Current version of Windows binaries: 3.1.00.

In general, the pre-built Windows binaries will only be updated when
there are significant functional changes of bug fixes in the code.  A
fully up to date version of the Windows binaries can always be created
from the source code.

Windows binaries for radiance-conversion code are cross-complies under
OpenSUSE using ming64.
