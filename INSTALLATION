To build the software for Linux:

1.  Install the packages cmake, libtiff, libtiff-devel, libjpeg8,
    libjpeg8-devel, libexif12, libexif-devel, libpng16-16, and
    libpng16-devel from the appropriate repository.  (Other versions of
    libjpeg may work as well.)

2.  Run the following commands from the top level of the
    radiance-conversion directory tree:

      cd build
      cmake ..
      make

3.  Copy the executable files rad2jpeg rad2png rad2tiff tiff2rad
    tiff32_to_8 from radiance-conversion/build to wherever you want
    them.

4.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of deva-filter source directory:

      distclean

---------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the software for MacOS:

1.  Install the package CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>

    Download and unpack Unix/Linux source from
    <http://www.cmake.org/download/>.

    In directory where the CMake source has been unpacked:

      ./bootstrap
      make
      sudo make install

2.  In directory where source has been unpacked, run the script:

      Mac-build-script

3.  Copy the executable files rad2jpeg, rad2png, rad2tiff, tiff2rad, and
    tiff32_to_8 from radiance-conversion/build-mac to wherever you want
    them.

4.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of deva-filter source directory:

      distclean

To build the software for Windows:

Currently, the only supported build for Windows targets involves cross
compiling on a Linux systems using Mingw-w64.  This approach can
probably be adapted to MacOS.  A native Windows build is also probably
doable with some work if you have Cmake and Mingw-w64 running on
Windows.

As currently structured, the Windows build produces a directly
executable versions of deva-filter, deva-visibility,
make-coordinates-file, deva-visualize-geometry, and
deva-compare-boundaries.  No installer or special permisions are
required.  On the other hand, you'll need to put the executable files in
whatever current directory you have for the command window or put the
.exe files in some fixed place and list the folder in your PATH
variable.

Text annotation of files output by deva-compare-boundaries is currently
not supported on Windows.

To build the Windows software by cross compiling on Linux:

1.  On the Linux system, install the packages cmake and
    mingw64-cross-gcc.

2.  In directory where source has been unpacked, run the script:

      Windows-build-script

3.  Copy the executable files deva-filter, deva-visibility,
    make-coordinates-file, deva-visualize-geometry,
    deva-compare-boundaries, luminance-boundaries, and
    geometry-boundaries from the build directory to wherever you want
    them.

4.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of deva-filter source directory:

      distclean
